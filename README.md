# Java Client–Server Applications

This repository contains several Java applications implementing **TCP Client/Server communication** using sockets, threads and custom protocols.

The goal of these projects is to explore:
- How TCP connections work
- How to handle multiple clients with threads
- How to exchange messages using input/output streams
- How to structure simple communication protocols
- How to build scalable server-side logic

---

## 🚀 Technologies
- Java 17+
- TCP sockets
- Multithreading
- BufferedReader / PrintWriter
- ServerSocket / Socket API

## 📂 Project Structure (examples)
- `/simple-client-server` → basic single-client test  
- `/multi-client-server` → threaded server that handles multiple clients  
- `/protocol-version` → structured request/response protocol  

> When the folders are ready, each one will contain its own README explaining how to run the project.
